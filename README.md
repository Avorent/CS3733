Welcome to the GitHub repository of the team Group 6 of the Software Engineering course provided by Worcester Polytechnic Institute.

This course is an introduction to Software Engineering. Students will work in teams ranging from four to six people to create a web application using current standard frameworks. The Java language will be used in this course and additional Java libraries related to web development. Over the course of this project students will experience the system design life cycle and cover several topics such as UML modeling, system architecture (layers), common design patterns, and full-stack development. This course will consist of six assignments related to the project (project deliverables), and a final exam on the concepts taught in the course.

Group 6 is one of the groups with randomly assigned students from the course who must complete the assignments together in team-based projects.

<p align="center"> Computer Science Professor Douglas Selent</p>
Doug Selent has worked with Neil Heffernan and the ASSISTments online tutoring system. His research has primarily been focused on several aspects related to large scale experimentation in online tutoring systems. He has developed a machine-learning algorithm to learn the incorrect processes students make from the students answer and the inputs of the problem and conducted several randomized controlled experiments in the ASSISTments system using this information to help students learn from their mistakes.
